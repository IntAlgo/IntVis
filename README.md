# IntAlgo - Interactive Graph Algorithm Visualizer

IntAlgo is an interactive graph algorithm visualizer website developed by Prof. Ranveer Singh at the Indian Institute of Technology, Indore. The project aims to provide a user-friendly platform to visualize Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms in action, along with the ability to manipulate a customized graph by adding, updating, and deleting nodes and edges.

## Technologies Used

- React JS: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, providing a smooth and responsive user experience.
- VisJS: A dynamic visualization library for creating interactive network graphs, ideal for illustrating graph algorithms.
- TailwindCSS: A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid and flexible UI development, ensuring a visually appealing design.

## Features

1. Algorithm Visualizations: IntAlgo allows users to visualize both DFS and BFS algorithms on custom graphs. The algorithm visualizations provide step-by-step animations to help users understand the traversal process.

2. Custom Graph Operations: Users can perform various operations on the graph, such as:
   - Adding Nodes: Add new nodes to the graph with custom labels.
   - Updating Nodes: Modify the labels of existing nodes for better identification.
   - Deleting Nodes: Remove unwanted nodes from the graph.
   - Adding Edges: Create edges between nodes to establish connections.
   - Deleting Edges: Remove edges to restructure the graph.

3. Intuitive User Interface: The website boasts an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it easy for users to interact with the graph and the visualization controls.

## How to Use

1. Clone the Repository

2. Install Dependencies:
